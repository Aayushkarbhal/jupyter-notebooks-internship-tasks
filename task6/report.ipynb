    "For this task, I was asked to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on the California Housing Dataset. The goal wasn't just to write code, but to understand why the model makes certain predictions and how to measure its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How I Built It:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Check: I started by loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame. I used .head() and .describe() to see the average house prices and check for any weird data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing the Model: I split the data into two parts: 80% for training the model and 20% for testing it. This is important because it tells us if the model can predict prices for houses it hasn't \"seen\" before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training: I used the LinearRegression() algorithm to find the line of best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: I asked the model to predict prices for the test set and compared them against the actual market prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results & Performance:\n",
    "To see how well I did, I calculated two main numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE (Mean Absolute Error): [Insert Your Value]. This is basically the average amount the model was \"off\" by.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): [Insert Your Value]. This number is slightly higher because it penalizes the model more for being way off on a single house price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing the Results\n",
    "I created a scatter plot to see how the predictions lined up with reality. Ideally, the dots should follow a straight diagonal line."
