# 📊 Data Science Internship: Learning & Implementation

This repository is a collection of 16 tasks completed during my Data Science internship. The focus was on mastering the fundamental Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning using real-world datasets from Kaggle.

---

## 🛠️ Core Learning Objectives
Throughout these 16 tasks, I focused on building a strong foundation in:

* **Data Manipulation:** Mastering `Pandas` for indexing, slicing, and transforming complex CSV datasets.
* **Numerical Computing:** Using `NumPy` for efficient array operations and mathematical functions.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating clear, insightful plots with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
* **Machine Learning:** Implementing baseline models (Regression, Classification) using `Scikit-learn`.

## 📂 Task Breakdown

The 16 tasks follow a progressive learning path:

1.  **Tasks 1-4: The Foundations** * Loading CSVs, basic data cleaning, and handling null values.
2.  **Tasks 5-8: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** * Statistical analysis and discovering patterns in Kaggle datasets.
3.  **Tasks 9-12: Advanced Visualization** * Crafting multi-variate plots, heatmaps, and distribution curves.
4.  **Tasks 13-16: Introduction to Modeling** * Feature scaling, splitting data, and running initial ML algorithms via Scikit-learn.
